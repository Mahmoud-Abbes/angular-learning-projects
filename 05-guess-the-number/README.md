# 05 – Guess the Number

Small Angular game built as a learning exercise.

## Purpose

Apply previously learned Angular concepts by building a complete game without following a tutorial step by step.

## What I practiced

- Managing component state
- Writing custom methods and game logic
- Handling user input and events
- Controlling game flow (win, lose, reset)

## Notes

The focus of this project was logical thinking and problem-solving rather than code perfection.

## Tech

- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML
- SCSS

> Learning project – built independently to reinforce fundamentals.
